    <p>Security, in information technology (IT), is the defense of digital information and IT assets against internal
        and external, malicious and accidental threats. This defense includes detection, prevention and response to
        threats through the use of security policies, software tools and IT services.
        Security is critical for enterprises and organizations of all sizes and in all industries. Weak security can
        result in compromised systems or data, either by a malicious threat actor or an unintentional internal threat.
        Not meeting security standards that are regulated by a separate organization or law, such as PCI DSS 3.0 or
        HIPAA compliance, can also result in financial penalties.
        Physical security
        Physical security is the protection of personnel, hardware, software, networks and data from physical actions,
        intrusions and other events that could damage an organization. This includes natural disasters, fire, theft and
        terrorism, among others. Physical security for enterprises often includes employee access control to the office
        buildings as well as specific locations, such as data centers. An example of a common physical security threat
        is an attacker gaining entry to an organization and using a USB storage drive to either copy and remove
        sensitive data or physically deliver malware directly to systems. Threats to physical security may require less
        technical savvy on the part of the attacker, but physical security is just as important as information security.
        Information security
        Information security, also called infosec, encompasses a broad set of strategies for managing the process, tools
        and policies that aim to prevent, detect and respond to threats to both digital and nondigital information
        assets. Infosec includes several specialized categories, including:
        Application security - the protection of applications from threats that seek to manipulate application and
        access, steal, modify or delete data. These protections use software, hardware and policies, and are sometimes
        called countermeasures. Common countermeasures include application firewalls, encryption programs, patch
        management and biometric authentication systems.

        Cloud security - the set of policies and technologies designed to protect data and infrastructure involved in a
        cloud computing environment. The top concerns that cloud security looks to address are identity and access
        management, and data privacy.

        Endpoint security - the part of network security that requires network devices nodes to meet certain security
        standards before they can connect to a secure network. Nodes devices include PCs, laptops, smartphones and
        tablets. Endpoint security also extends to equipment like point-of-sale (POS) terminals, bar code readers and
        IoT devices.
        Internet security - the protection of software applications, web browsers and virtual private networks (VPNs)
        that use the internet. Using techniques such as encryption and internet security aim to defend the transfer of
        data from attacks like malware and phishing as well as denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.
        Mobile security - the protection of portable devices, such as smartphones, tablets and laptops. Mobile security,
        also known as wireless security, secures the devices and the networks they connect to in order to prevent theft,
        data leakage and malware attacks.
        Network security - the protection of a network infrastructure and the devices connected to it through
        technologies, policies and practices. Network security defends against threats such as unauthorized access, and
        malicious use and modifications.
        Security concepts and principles
        Security in IT is a broad concept that blankets many different ideas and principles. Some of the most important
        security concepts and principles are:
        Defense in depth - a strategy that uses multiple countermeasures to protect information and is based on the
        military principle that it's more difficult for an enemy to beat a multilayered defense system than it is to
        beat a single layer.

        Least privilege - a principle that limits user and program access to the lowest possible level of access rights
        in order to strengthen security.
        Vulnerability management - an approach to security that requires checking for vulnerabilities, identifying them,
        verifying them, mitigating them and patching the vulnerabilities.
        Risk management - the process of identifying, assessing and controlling risks to an organization's IT
        environment.
        Patch management - an area of systems management that involves acquiring, testing and installing patches and
        updates for flawed code in applications, operating systems and firmware.
        Application lifecycle management - the concept of protecting all stages of the development of an application to
        reduce its exposure to bugs, design flaws and configuration errors, such as not changing default passwords that
        could be exploited by attackers.
        While there are many other concepts and principles that make up security, these are some of the most important.
        The combination of all of these principles will not guarantee security for an organization, but it puts the
        organization in a better position to defend itself from infosec threats.

        result in compromised systems or data, either by a malicious threat actor or an unintentional internal threat.
        Not meeting security standards that are regulated by a separate organization or law, such as PCI DSS 3.0 or
        HIPAA compliance, can also result in financial penalties.
        Physical security
        Physical security is the protection of personnel, hardware, software, networks and data from physical actions,
        intrusions and other events that could damage an organization. This includes natural disasters, fire, theft and
        terrorism, among others. Physical security for enterprises often includes employee access control to the office
        buildings as well as specific locations, such as data centers. An example of a common physical security threat
        is an attacker gaining entry to an organization and using a USB storage drive to either copy and remove
        sensitive data or physically deliver malware directly to systems. Threats to physical security may require less
        technical savvy on the part of the attacker, but physical security is just as important as information security.
        Information security
        Information security, also called infosec, encompasses a broad set of strategies for managing the process, tools
        and policies that aim to prevent, detect and respond to threats to both digital and nondigital information
        assets. Infosec includes several specialized categories, including:
        Application security - the protection of applications from threats that seek to manipulate application and
        access, steal, modify or delete data. These protections use software, hardware and policies, and are sometimes
        called countermeasures. Common countermeasures include application firewalls, encryption programs, patch
        management and biometric authentication systems.

        Cloud security - the set of policies and technologies designed to protect data and infrastructure involved in a
        cloud computing environment. The top concerns that cloud security looks to address are identity and access
        management, and data privacy.

        Endpoint security - the part of network security that requires network devices nodes to meet certain security
        standards before they can connect to a secure network. Nodes devices include PCs, laptops, smartphones and
        tablets. Endpoint security also extends to equipment like point-of-sale (POS) terminals, bar code readers and
        IoT devices.
        Internet security - the protection of software applications, web browsers and virtual private networks (VPNs)
        that use the internet. Using techniques such as encryption and internet security aim to defend the transfer of
        data from attacks like malware and phishing as well as denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.
        Mobile security - the protection of portable devices, such as smartphones, tablets and laptops. Mobile security,
        also known as wireless security, secures the devices and the networks they connect to in order to prevent theft,
        data leakage and malware attacks.
        Network security - the protection of a network infrastructure and the devices connected to it through
        technologies, policies and practices. Network security defends against threats such as unauthorized access, and
        malicious use and modifications.
        Security concepts and principles
        Security in IT is a broad concept that blankets many different ideas and principles. Some of the most important
        security concepts and principles are:
        Defense in depth - a strategy that uses multiple countermeasures to protect information and is based on the
        military principle that it's more difficult for an enemy to beat a multilayered defense system than it is to
        beat a single layer.

        Least privilege - a principle that limits user and program access to the lowest possible level of access rights
        in order to strengthen security.
        Vulnerability management - an approach to security that requires checking for vulnerabilities, identifying them,
        verifying them, mitigating them and patching the vulnerabilities.
        Risk management - the process of identifying, assessing and controlling risks to an organization's IT
        environment.
        Patch management - an area of systems management that involves acquiring, testing and installing patches and
        updates for flawed code in applications, operating systems and firmware.
        Application lifecycle management - the concept of protecting all stages of the development of an application to
        reduce its exposure to bugs, design flaws and configuration errors, such as not changing default passwords that
        could be exploited by attackers.
        While there are many other concepts and principles that make up security, these are some of the most important.
        The combination of all of these principles will not guarantee security for an organization, but it puts the
        organization in a better position to defend itself from infosec threats.
        Security, in information technology (IT), is the defense of digital information and IT assets against internal
        and external, malicious and accidental threats. This defense includes detection, prevention and response to
        threats through the use of security policies, software tools and IT services.
        Security is critical for enterprises and organizations of all sizes and in all industries. Weak security can

        access, steal, modify or delete data. These protections use software, hardware and policies, and are sometimes
        called countermeasures. Common countermeasures include application firewalls, encryption programs, patch
        management and biometric authentication systems.

        Learn from the past: Ensure a secure future of information security
        Cloud security - the set of policies and technologies designed to protect data and infrastructure involved in a
        cloud computing environment. The top concerns that cloud security looks to address are identity and access
        management, and data privacy.

        Endpoint security - the part of network security that requires network devices nodes to meet certain security
        standards before they can connect to a secure network. Nodes devices include PCs, laptops, smartphones and
        tablets. Endpoint security also extends to equipment like point-of-sale (POS) terminals, bar code readers and
        IoT devices.
        Internet security - the protection of software applications, web browsers and virtual private networks (VPNs)
        that use the internet. Using techniques such as encryption and internet security aim to defend the transfer of
        data from attacks like malware and phishing as well as denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.
        Mobile security - the protection of portable devices, such as smartphones, tablets and laptops. Mobile security,
        also known as wireless security, secures the devices and the networks they connect to in order to prevent theft,
        data leakage and malware attacks.
        Network security - the protection of a network infrastructure and the devices connected to it through
        technologies, policies and practices. Network security defends against threats such as unauthorized access, and
        malicious use and modifications.
        Security concepts and principles
        Security in IT is a broad concept that blankets many different ideas and principles. Some of the most important
        security concepts and principles are:
        Defense in depth - a strategy that uses multiple countermeasures to protect information and is based on the
        military principle that it's more difficult for an enemy to beat a multilayered defense system than it is to
        beat a single layer.

        Least privilege - a principle that limits user and program access to the lowest possible level of access rights
        in order to strengthen security.
        Vulnerability management - an approach to security that requires checking for vulnerabilities, identifying them,
        verifying them, mitigating them and patching the vulnerabilities.
        Risk management - the process of identifying, assessing and controlling risks to an organization's IT
        environment.
        Patch management - an area of systems management that involves acquiring, testing and installing patches and
        updates for flawed code in applications, operating systems and firmware.
        Application lifecycle management - the concept of protecting all stages of the development of an application to
        reduce its exposure to bugs, design flaws and configuration errors, such as not changing default passwords that
        could be exploited by attackers.
        While there are many other concepts and principles that make up security, these are some of the most important.
        The combination of all of these principles will not guarantee security for an organization, but it puts the
        organization in a better position to defend itself from infosec threats.
        Security, in information technology (IT), is the defense of digital information and IT assets against internal
        and external, malicious and accidental threats. This defense includes detection, prevention and response to
        threats through the use of security policies, software tools and IT services.
        Security is critical for enterprises and organizations of all sizes and in all industries. Weak security can
        result in compromised systems or data, either by a malicious threat actor or an unintentional internal threat.
        Not meeting security standards that are regulated by a separate organization or law, such as PCI DSS 3.0 or
        HIPAA compliance, can also result in financial penalties.
        Physical security
        Physical security is the protection of personnel, hardware, software, networks and data from physical actions,
        intrusions and other events that could damage an organization. This includes natural disasters, fire, theft and
        terrorism, among others. Physical security for enterprises often includes employee access control to the office
        buildings as well as specific locations, such as data centers. An example of a common physical security threat
        is an attacker gaining entry to an organization and using a USB storage drive to either copy and remove
        sensitive data or physically deliver malware directly to systems. Threats to physical security may require less
        technical savvy on the part of the attacker, but physical security is just as important as information security.
        Information security
        Information security, also called infosec, encompasses a broad set of strategies for managing the process, tools
        and policies that aim to prevent, detect and respond to threats to both digital and nondigital information
        assets. Infosec includes several specialized categories, including:
        Application security - the protection of applications from threats that seek to manipulate application and
        access, steal, modify or delete data. These protections use software, hardware and policies, and are sometimes
        called countermeasures. Common countermeasures include application firewalls, encryption programs, patch
        management and biometric authentication systems.
